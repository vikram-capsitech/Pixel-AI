## 🚀 What is PixelUI?

PixelUI is a modern, modular React component library crafted for developers who want eye-catching UI **without** the bloat. Here’s the kicker:

- **AI-enabled components** that can adapt and enhance user experience dynamically.
- **Animated backgrounds and elements** for that smooth, futuristic feel.
- Ultra-lightweight & optimized to keep your apps fast.
- Easy to install and start using — no complex setup needed.

Think of PixelUI as your go-to toolkit to build interfaces that **look alive** and **feel smart**.

## 📁 Project Structure: Docs & Web

- **`docs/`**  
  This is your **live documentation site** and demo playground.  
  This folder powers the official PixelUI website you’ll deploy and share with the world. It uses Next.js App Router for modern routing and fast builds.  

- **`web/`**  
  This folder is meant for **local development** only — your team’s playground for building, testing, and experimenting with PixelUI components in real-time.  
  Keep your dev workflow here isolated to avoid conflicts with your public docs.
